<h1>This component loads its heroes by itself, and introduces a delay after the list is loaded before scrolling</h1>

<p>Scroll to the end of the page, click on the detail of a hero and come back: the position **will** finally be restored.</p>

<div *ngFor="let hero of heroes">
  <a routerLink="/detail">{{ hero.id }} - {{ hero.name }}</a>
</div>
